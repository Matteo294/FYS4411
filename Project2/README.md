To download the project go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Matteo294/FYS4411) and click on the green button **Code** on the top right, then **Download ZIP**.  
The folder **Project2** is structured in two subfolders:
1. **paper** contains the pdf report for the project, the related images and the .gif animations 
2. **code** contains a Jupyter Notebook file and a .py file with the modules implemented by us. The documentation is also added both in html and pdf format

In order to run the code, the user needs to install the ```quantum-system``` library from [this repository](https://github.com/Schoyen/quantum-systems).

The Jupyter Notebook file contains some functions that perform the main tasks requested for the project, but the user should feel free to manipulate the Notebook according to the needs.
