In our code implementation, the non-interacting case has been treated separately from the interacting one, namely the user can choose to adopt a spherical or elliptical hamiltonian, corresponding to a gaussian or asymmetric gaussian as wavefunction. A brief test was conducted in order to find some possible mistakes in the implementation of the functions for the interacting case. We report some simulations performed with the elliptical Hamiltonian (see Eq.\,\ref{hamiltonian} and Eq.\,\ref{elliptical_pot}) and the full wavefunction (see Eq.\,\ref{wavefunctions}) with the parameters set as in the non-interacting case, namely $\beta=\omega_z=1$ and $a=0$. We report here the results for $\langle E_L(\alpha)$ estimated within a VMC simulation based on the importance sampling with $\delta t = 0.1$ and $2^{21}$ steps for a 3D system of 10 particles. From the following table is possible to notice that the results obtained with the properly tuned interacting hamiltonian are compatible with those obtained in the non-interacting case.

    \caption{Comparison between the results obtained with a gaussian wavefunction combined with a non-interacting Hamiltonian (results labelled as $NI$) and a asymmetric gaussian wavefunction combined with an elliptical Hamiltonian with $\beta=\omega_{ho}=1$ and $a=0$ (results labelled as $I$). The simulations were performed with the importance sampling algorithm with $\delta t=0.1$, $N_{therm}=10^5$, $N_{steps}=2^{21}$ for a 10 particles $3D$ system. The uncertainty comes from the blocking method estimation. }
