The two mandatory projects, with related reports, are located in the respective directories.

### Project 1: Variational MC for trapped bosons
The project consists in the study, via a variational Monte Carlo method, of a system of interacting bosons trapped in an elliptical potential.
We developed a general tool to study a physical problem via Quantum Monte Carlo methods and we then implemented problem specific hamiltonians and trial wavefunctions to study the problem.
  
All the information about the project and how to run it can be found in the readme inside the folder

### Project 2: Hartree-Fock method for a system of 2 trapped electrons
We implemented an Hartree-Fock solver both for the time-dependent and time-independent domain to access the properties of a system of 2 electrons trapped in an harmonic oscillator potential. The main objective was to reproduce the results of the [article](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-4075/37/4/004) by Zanghellini et al., but also other features of the apparatus were tested.

The corresponding folder contains all the information about the project and the instructions to get the code running.
