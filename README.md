This is the repository for the **Computationl Physics II** class at UiO.  
   
**Group member**s: Emiliano Staffoli, Matteo Zortea, Aexander Ferraro  

The two mandatory projects, with related reports, are located in the respective directories (only Project1 visible now).

### Project 1: Variational MC for trapped bosons
The project consists in the study, via a variational Monte Carlo method, of a system of interacting bosons trapped in an elliptical potential.
We developed a general tool to study a physical problem via Quantum Monte Carlo methods and we then implemented problem specific hamiltonians and trial wavefunctions to study the problem.
  
All the information about the project and how to run it can be found in the readme inside the folder
